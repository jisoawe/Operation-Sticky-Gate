# What is Operation Sticky Gate?

Major League Baseball's 2021 season has been marked by record breaking statistics. Particularly the record low ERA's and extremely high spin rates.

## Before the Crackdown


## Velocity vs Spin Rate


```{r}
library(ggplot2) ## loading packages
library(ggExtra)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
```



```{r}
b4 <-
  read.csv('b4June1.csv')
b4
```



```{r}
b4gr <-
  b4 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = velocity, y = spin_rate, color = total_pitches)) +
  geom_point(stat = 'identity') +
  xlab('Velocity (mph)') +
  ylab('Spin Rate (rpm)') +
  ggtitle('Spin Rate VS Velocity Prior to June 1st')

p1 <-
  ggMarginal(b4gr, type = 'histogram')
