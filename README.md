# Operation-Sticky-Gate
### Overview
This project analyzes changes in the release spin rates of several MLB pitchers over time, utilizing data from Baseball Savant and Baseball Reference. The primary goal is to identify trends and patterns in spin rate fluctuations and understand their potential impact on pitching performance.

## Key Objectives:
- Analyze spin rate data over multiple seasons to detect significant changes or trends.
- Visualize the data using comprehensive graphs and charts to highlight key fluctuations and their potential correlation with performance metrics.
- Investigate external factors such as rule changes or performance variability that might explain these fluctuations.
## Methodology:
1. Data Acquisition:

  - Collected relevant datasets from Baseball Savant and Baseball Reference focusing on pitcher-specific spin rates and associated performance metrics.
2. Data Analysis:

  - Cleaned and processed the data using R packages such as dplyr, lubridate, and the Tidyverse suite.
  - Performed statistical analysis to uncover significant changes in spin rates across different time frames.
3. Data Visualization:

  - Developed visualizations using ggplot2 and ggExtra to effectively display trends and outliers in spin rates.
  - Plotted key events and time periods to better understand spin rate changes' possible impact on pitcher effectiveness.
## Tools & Libraries:
- R Programming Language
- ggplot2 for advanced data visualization
- dplyr and tidyverse for data manipulation
- lubridate for date and time management
- ggExtra for creating additional plots and enhancing ggplot2 outputs
## Results:
- Visualizations show clear patterns of spin rate variations across different periods, with some pitchers displaying marked increases or decreases in spin rate.
- Potential correlations between spin rate changes and other factors such as velocity changes and performance metrics were identified.
- Further insights suggest external influences, such as the enforcement of foreign substance regulations, could have contributed to these spin rate fluctuations.
